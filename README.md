## Testing

Testing was a diffucult task but I was able to bring Muiz to life by the help of the Student Care team and [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/).

## Deployment
The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
* In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
* From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
* Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

## Credits 

[W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/) helped me with the majority of the JavaScript code.
